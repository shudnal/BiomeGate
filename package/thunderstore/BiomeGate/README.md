# BiomeGate
Prevent players from exploring and interacting with selected biomes. Protect your server from racing ahead lovers.

Player in selected biomes will be affected by status effect which
* reduce damage dealt
* increase damage received
* reduce sneak and increase noise
* prevent skills from raising
* prevent building (hammer, hoe, cultivator and custom hammers)
* prevent interaction with all interactable objects
* prevent minimap exploring

You can allow admins to ignore effect (enabled by default).

Effects are configurable.
